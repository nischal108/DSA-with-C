# DSA with C

Welcome to the "DSA with C" repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the lens of the C programming language.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of C code implementations that cover various data structures and algorithms. 

## Contents

- **Data Structures:** Explore well-documented C code for fundamental and advanced data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

- **Algorithms:** Find algorithmic solutions for common programming challenges and problems implemented in C.

## Getting Started

Feel free to navigate through the directories to explore different data structures and algorithms. Each code snippet is accompanied by comments to explain the logic and functionality.

```c
// Example: Hello World in C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, DSA with C!\n");
    return 0;
}



- ** Learning is a continuous journey, and I'll be updating this repository with more content as I delve deeper into the world of DSA with C. **
